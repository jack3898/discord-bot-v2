# discord-bot-v2

My own Discord bot I develop just for fun! Adding in random commands all the time.

## Environment variables

You will need two environment variables:

-   GOOGLE_API_TOKEN - Used for communicating with the Google API
-   DISCORD_TOKEN - Used to authenticate with a bot user

## Note
This bot currently only works on Windows.
